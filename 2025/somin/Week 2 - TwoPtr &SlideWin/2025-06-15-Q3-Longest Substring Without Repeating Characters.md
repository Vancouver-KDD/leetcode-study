            // and remove characters until the duplicate is removed

            // Update max length if current window is longer
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);

            // Move the right pointer to expand the window

1. Time Complexity: O(n)
The right pointer traverses the string from left to right once â†’ O(n)

The left pointer also moves at most n times across the entire string

Every character is added to and removed from the set at most once

So, even though it looks like a nested loop, it behaves like a sliding window, meaning:

Each character is processed at most twice (once in, once out)

ðŸ‘‰ Total Time Complexity = O(n), where n = s.length().

2. Space Complexity: O(k) -> O(1)
- HashSet<Character> stores at most k unique characters at any time
- In the worst case (no duplicates), the set could grow up to the size of the string
