"""Find Target in Rotated Sorted Array
You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:
[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.
Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer target, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.
You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,
A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,1,2], target = 1
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,5,6,0,1,2], target = 4
Output: -1
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-1000 <= target <= 1000
