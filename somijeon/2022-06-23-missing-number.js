// Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n],
// return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

//* Example 1:

// Input: nums = [3,0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

//* Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,1]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

const missingNumber = function (nums) {
  let ret = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    ret ^= i;
    ret ^= nums[i];
  }
  return (ret ^= nums.length);
};
