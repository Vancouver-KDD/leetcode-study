// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

// Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

// Example 1:

// Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
// Output: 3
// Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

// Example 2:

// Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
// Output: -1

const coinChange = (coins, amount) => {
  const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity); // This arr tells us how many coins we need for each amount.
  dp[0] = 0; // To make 0, we need 0 coins.
  for (let coin of coins) {
    for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
      dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1); // Update minimum number of needed coins.
    }
  }
  return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount]; // If the last element is Infinity, then we cannot make the amount.
